abstract: With the rapid development of blockchain platforms, it is important that different implementations are tested and analyzed for comparative purposes. One such implementation is Hyperledger Sawtooth, a new member of the Hyperledger family. Sawtooth blockchain is a permissioned implementation developed in part by Intel. While research has been done on Hyperledger Fabric, research on Sawtooth is not well documented. Using the Hyperledger Caliper benchmarking tool, we aim to test the performance of the blockchain and identify potential issues.
