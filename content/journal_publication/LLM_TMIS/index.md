abstract: The exponential growth of digital content has generated massive textual datasets, necessitating the use of advanced analytical approaches. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as tools that are capable of processing and extracting insights from massive unstructured textual datasets. However, how to leverage LLMs for text analytics Information Systems (IS) research is currently unclear. To assist the IS community in understanding how to operationalize LLMs, we propose a Text Analytics for Information Systems Research (TAISR) framework. Our proposed framework provides detailed recommendations grounded in IS and LLM literature on how to conduct meaningful text analytics IS research for design science, behavioral, and econometric streams. We conducted three business intelligence case studies using our TAISR framework to demonstrate its application in several IS research contexts. We also outline the potential challenges and limitations of adopting LLMs for IS. By offering a systematic approach and evidence of its utility, our TAISR framework contributes to future IS research streams looking to incorporate powerful LLMs for text analytics.
